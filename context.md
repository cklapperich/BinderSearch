C#, bepinex, unity 2021.3.38, 

Bepin mod plugin for a game called Card Shop Simulator

We need to: 

1. find the code related to the Card Binder UI

2. implement a partially complete text search - find the first match for the n characters entered
squir -> squirtle
squirll -> NA
squi - squirtle
blastois -> blastoise
p -> pidgey (alphabetically first)

3. based on "new name" plugin

Binder opening is tied to a hotkey, but the hotkey only works when in the binder UI

hotkey is changeable from a bepin config menu
